x-chat is my website name and the logo needs to include that :)
i have attached some images of the site as it is now and you can also visit it if you want: x-chat.co
I do not have a colour preference. I'm not good at picking coluors so you can decide what you think will look good with the website.
it should include the name x-chat but rest up to you
you pick the font. Something more modern not old.
The website users a combination of verdana and Arial.
